# uPheno Ontology Documentation

The Unified phenotype ontology (uPheno) aims to unify the annotation of phenotypes across species by integrating multiple phenotype ontologies.

You can find descriptions of the standard ontology engineering workflows [here](odk-workflows/index.md).

This documentation is still under development.
